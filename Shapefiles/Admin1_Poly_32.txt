  Description:
    Abstract: International Administrative Boundaries of Afghanistan contains International boundaries for Afghanistan, mapped at 1:100,000 scale from the United States Defense Mapping Agency (USDMA) topos. The coverage contains polygon topology and was created in AtlasGIS by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and later was converted and updated to ESRI shapefile mapped at 1:100,000 scale by AIMS.  Border in the east and south east of Afghanistan was digitized from the Quarter Inch English Map at scale 1:254,440.
    Purpose: The polygon provides a ready reference for country boundaries at 1:100,000 scale.  Not to be used for scales  larger than 1:100,000 when applying for planning.  Data at this  scale is  suitable for use in regional studies and planning.

      Process_Description:
        International Boundaries of Afghanistan, contains International boundaries for Afghanistan. The shapefile has polygon topology and was created in AtlasGIS by (USAID) and later on was updated
        to ArcView shapefile at AIMS. shapefile attributes were carefully examined for accuracy based on existing source material (USDMA 100K maps)and limitations of scale. NODE ERRORS were resolved. The shapefile was CLEANED and BUILT with POLYGON topology.
