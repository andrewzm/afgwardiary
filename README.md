===========

Purpose:    Replication code for the paper "Point process modelling of the Afghan War Diary"

            The raw AWD is not available for download via this repository and is instead available on the PNAS web site.
            Necessary data in MATLAB/R is, however, provided.

Usage:      Each folder contains MATLAB or R files which are self-contained scripts. When more than one file is present or the file to run is not obvious, dedicated readme files are present with further instructions. The three most important/relevant folders in this work are Main_VBAnalysis, Main_ResultsSection and Main_PredictionSection with code for the inference, result plotting and prediction of the AWD respectively. TextS6_BasisSelection contains code for selecting basis at the appropriate resolution after the PACF/PCCF analysis using code in TextS6_SpatialAnalysis. The names of the other folders are indicative of which section in the paper the code they contain is relevant to.
